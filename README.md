# LaptopShopper
This project is made by Andrew Sen, Darya Anbar, and Ethan Ferneyhough


## Project Scope
The scope of the project is to improve the online laptop shopping experience for users. We are building a **Discord** bot that
- Converses with users about their desired laptop
- Scrapes the web for relevant information
- Summarizes and displays its findings in tabular format


## Team Member Responsibilites (Subject to Change)
Each team member will implement one of the following:
- Chatbot for interaction with user
- Information extraction via web scraping multiple webpages
- Summarization of products found 

### Backup Plan
We may need to leverage a GPT model to pull data and extract information for laptops

### Stretch goal
Fake review checking


## Data Sources
Any electronic selling website such as: Amazon, Dell, any electronic store for Laptops
